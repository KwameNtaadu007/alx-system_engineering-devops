# Load balancer

To improve our web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers to allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable, we build a replica server in this project. If one web server fails, we still have a second one to handle requests.


## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Double the number of webservers**
  * [0-custom_http_response_header](./0-custom_http_response-header): Bash
  script that installs and configures Nginx on a server with a custom HTTP
  response header.
    * The name of the HTTP header is `X-Served-By`.
    * The value of the HTTP header is the hostname of the server.

* **1. Install your load balancer**
  * [1-install_load_balancer](./1-install_load_balancer): Bash script that
  installs and configures HAproxy version 1.5 on a server.
    * Enables management via the init script.
    * Requests are distributed using a round-robin algorithm.
