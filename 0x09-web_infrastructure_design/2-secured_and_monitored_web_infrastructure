##Secured and monitored web infrastructure

In designing a secured and monitored three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, we need to add 3 firewalls, 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS, and 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services).

Firewall 1: Located in front of the load balancer. Inspects and filters all incoming traffic, blocking malicious traffic and unauthorized access.

Firewall 2: Located between the load balancer and the web servers. Protects the web servers from direct attacks and only allows traffic from the load balancer to the web servers.

Firewall 3: Located between the web servers and the database server. Protects the database server from direct attacks and only allows traffic from the web servers to the database server.

#Load Balancer
	-Distributes incoming traffic evenly across the web servers.
	-Ensures that the website can handle high levels of traffic without any downtime.

#Web Server 1
	-Hosts the website files and serves them to users
	-Is configured to use the SSL certificate to serve encrypted traffic

#Web Server 2
	-Hosts the same website files as Web Server 1 and serves them to users
	-Is configured to use the SSL certificate to serve encrypted traffic


#Database Server
	-Stores the website database.
	-Is only accessible to the web servers.

Firewalls are added to prevent unauthorized access to the network and protect against cyber attacks. They act as a barrier between the internet and the network, filtering out unwanted traffic and allowing only authorized traffic to pass through.

The SSL certificate will be installed on the load balancer and the web servers. This will allow the website to be served over HTTPS. HTTPS is used to encrypt the traffic between the userâ€™s browser and the web server, making it more secure. It is important to use HTTPS because it protects sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data from being intercepted by hackers or being sent in plain text over the network infrastructure or channels.

Monitoring is used to track the performance of the web infrastructure and identify any issues that may arise. Monitoring clients collect data on various aspects of the infrastructure such as server uptime, response time, and resource utilization. Sumologic is one example of a monitoring service that can be used to collect data.

To monitor web server queries per second (QPS), we can use a tool like Apache JMeter or Gatling. These tools simulate user traffic on the website and measure the number of queries per second (QPS) that the server can handle.

This infrastructure is reliable because it uses a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across the web servers. This ensures that the website can handle high levels of traffic without any downtime. Additionally, the database server is only accessible to the web servers, which helps to protect it from attacks.

This infrastructure is scalable because it is easy to add more web servers to handle increased traffic. Simply add a new web server and connect it to the load balancer. The 

This infrastructure is secure because it uses three firewalls to protect the website from attacks. The first firewall is located in front of the load balancer and blocks malicious traffic and unauthorized access. The second firewall is located between the load balancer and the web servers and protects the web servers from direct attacks. The third firewall is located between the web servers and the database server and protects the database server from direct attacks.

However one issue with this infrastructure is that terminating SSL at the load balancer level can be an issue because it exposes sensitive information such as session cookies to potential attackers. Another issue is having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes because it creates a single point of failure. Finally, having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem because it can lead to performance bottlenecks and make it difficult to scale.

In conclusion this three server web infrastructure is secure, reliable, scalable, and monitored. It is a good choice for businesses that need a website that can handle high levels of traffic without any downtime.
