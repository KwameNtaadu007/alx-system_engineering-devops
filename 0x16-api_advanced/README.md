# API Advanced Project

## Objective

This learning project focuses on developing skills related to working with APIs, including reading API documentation, handling pagination, parsing JSON responses, making recursive API calls, and sorting dictionaries by value.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Reading API Documentation:**
   - Learn how to navigate and interpret API documentation.
   - Understand how to find the specific endpoints needed for a given task.

2. **API Pagination:**
   - Gain proficiency in handling APIs with pagination.
   - Learn how to fetch and process paginated data to retrieve complete results.

3. **JSON Parsing:**
   - Develop skills in parsing JSON responses from an API.
   - Understand how to extract relevant information from JSON data.

4. **Recursive API Calls:**
   - Learn how to make recursive API calls to retrieve all available data.
   - Understand the concept of recursion in the context of API requests.

5. **Sorting Dictionaries by Value:**
   - Gain proficiency in sorting dictionaries based on their values.
   - Understand the importance of sorting data for meaningful analysis.

## Project Structure

### 1. Reading API Documentation

- **Task:**
  - Choose an API to work with.
  - Read the documentation to understand the available endpoints.

### 2. API Pagination

- **Task:**
  - Select an API that supports pagination.
  - Implement code to handle paginated responses and fetch complete data.

### 3. JSON Parsing

- **Task:**
  - Retrieve data from the chosen API.
  - Develop code to parse JSON responses and extract relevant information.

### 4. Recursive API Calls

- **Task:**
  - Choose an API with nested or paginated data.
  - Implement a recursive function to retrieve all available data.

### 5. Sorting Dictionaries by Value

- **Task:**
  - Retrieve data that can be represented as a dictionary.
  - Develop code to sort the dictionary by its values.

## Getting Started

1. **Choose an API:**
   - Select an API that aligns with your interests or project requirements.
   - Examples: Reddit API, GitHub API, OpenWeatherMap API, etc.

2. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install necessary libraries (e.g., `requests` for handling HTTP requests).

3. **Review Documentation:**
   - Carefully read the API documentation to understand available endpoints, authentication requirements, and response formats.

4. **Implement Tasks:**
   - Work on each task sequentially, applying concepts learned from the objectives.

5. **Documentation and Reflection:**
   - Document your findings and implementations in a README file.
   - Reflect on challenges faced, lessons learned, and improvements made during the project.
