# 0x19 - Postmortem

## Introduction

Project 0x19 is an focused on learning and improvement within the realm of software engineering. It acknowledges that system failures are inevitable and considers them as valuable opportunities for growth. The project emphasizes the importance of conducting postmortems after any outage, aiming to achieve two primary goals: providing comprehensive information to the company's stakeholders and ensuring that the root cause of the outage is identified and addressed to prevent future occurrences.

## Purpose

The purpose of Project 0x19 is to establish a systematic approach to handling system failures and outages. By adopting postmortems, the project aims to:

1. **Inform Stakeholders:**
   - Ensure that managers and executives have easy access to detailed information regarding the cause of the outage.
   - Communicate the impact of the outage on the company's operations and services.

2. **Learn and Improve:**
   - Identify the root cause(s) of the outage to prevent recurrence.
   - Establish measures and protocols to fix and mitigate identified issues.

## Postmortem Process

The postmortem process within Project 0x19 follows a structured approach:

1. **Issue Identification:**
   - Acknowledge that system failures are normal and inevitable.
   - Embrace outages as learning opportunities.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Document the duration of the outage, impact on users, and any immediate actions taken.
   - Provide a timeline of events leading up to, during, and after the outage.

3. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root cause(s) of the outage.
   - Explore all possible factors, including bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, human error, etc.

4. **Summary and Communication:**
   - Summarize the findings in a postmortem report that is accessible to all employees.
   - Clearly communicate the impact of the outage and the steps taken for resolution.

5. **Corrective Measures:**
   - Implement immediate fixes to address the identified root cause.
   - Develop a plan for long-term corrective measures to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Learning Culture

Postmortem promotes a learning culture within an organization, recognizing that failing is part of the development process. The emphasis is on learning from mistakes, avoiding repeated failures, and continuously improving systems and processes.

## How to Contribute

1. **Participate in Postmortems:**
   - Actively contribute to postmortem discussions and investigations.
   - Share insights and experiences to enhance collective learning.

2. **Propose Improvements:**
   - Suggest improvements to existing processes based on lessons learned from outages.
   - Advocate for the adoption of best practices in software engineering.

3. **Promote Transparency:**
   - Encourage transparent communication about outages and their impact.
   - Share knowledge gained from postmortems with team members.

## Conclusion

Project 0x19 aims to foster a resilient and learning-oriented culture. By embracing the inevitability of system failures and actively participating in postmortems, the project seeks to empower teams to learn, improve, and contribute to the overall success and reliability of the company's software systems.
