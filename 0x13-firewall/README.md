# 0x13. Firewall


Firewalls are critical components of network security that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They can be categorized into two primary types:

1. **Network Firewalls (Hardware or Software):**
    - **Hardware Firewalls:** These are physical devices placed between your internal network and the internet. They typically offer strong security and are suited for protecting an entire network. Hardware firewalls are often found in routers or standalone firewall appliances.
    - **Software Firewalls:** Installed on individual computers or servers, software firewalls are applications that control traffic to and from specific machines. They provide protection on a per-device basis and are commonly included in operating systems or available as separate security software.

2. **Application Layer Firewalls (Proxy Firewalls):**
    - Application layer firewalls operate at the application level of the OSI model, examining data packets at Layer 7. These firewalls understand specific protocols and can filter and block traffic based on the application content. They provide more granular control but can introduce higher latency due to detailed packet inspection.
    - Proxy firewalls fall into this category, acting as intermediaries between client and server connections. They inspect, filter, and forward requests, acting as a buffer between internal and external networks.

Each type of firewall has its advantages and use cases, and many modern network security strategies may use a combination of these types to provide comprehensive protection against various cyber threats.
