#0x0B. SSH

##Overview
This project aims to impart knowledge about fundamental concepts related to servers, SSH, RSA key pair creation, and remote host connections. The learning objectives include understanding the significance of servers, SSH, and connecting to remote hosts securely via SSH keys.

##Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you'll be able to explain the following concepts without the aid of external resources:

##General Knowledge

###What is a Server?

Understand the concept of a server as a computer or system that provides resources or services to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

###Server Locations

Know where servers are usually located, either physically or virtually, and comprehend different server architectures like cloud-based servers or on-premises servers.

###SSH (Secure Shell)

Define SSH as a cryptographic network protocol used for secure remote access to systems over an unsecured network. Understand its role in providing secure communication channels between two devices.

###Creating SSH RSA Key Pair

Learn the process of generating an SSH RSA key pair (public and private keys) using tools like ssh-keygen or other relevant methods.
Connecting to Remote Hosts via SSH

Understand the procedure to establish a secure connection to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair. Know the essential steps involved in connecting securely.
Advantages of #!/usr/bin/env bash

Explain the advantages of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over /bin/bash for scripting purposes, including portability and flexibility in locating the Bash interpreter.
